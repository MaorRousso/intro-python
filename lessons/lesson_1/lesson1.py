# Lesson 1
# In this lesson we discuss basic operations, variables, if/else
# We also go over topics of boolean operators and arithmetic operators

# = -> assignment operator 
# assigns the right hand side to the left

# + -> string concatination
# "str1" + "str2" = "str1str2"

# 5/2 = 4/2 + 1/2 = 2 + 1/2 = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5
# Integer division -> 5/2 = 2 

# Convert to string -> str(parameter)

# Recognize value -> type(parameter)

# Comparison Operators:
# Less than <
# Less than or equals to <=
# Greater than >
# Greater than or equals to >=
# Equals to ==

# if clause -> if:
# else if clause -> elif:
# else clause -> else:
